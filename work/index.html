                    <p>This project is a simple yet informative one page layout.
                      It is for a roaming food truck business that aims to display
                      their menu and awesome reviews. The company’s green brand colors
                      pop out and immediately capture the viewer's attention. The page’s
                      content is also well organized and easy to find making the flow
                      of the website optimal for the user’s experience.

                    <p class="subheading">HTML 5 &amp; CSS website</p>
                    <p>This is a portfolio site design I did during my first HTML & CSS class.
                      It is a basic one page site that acts as the developers
                      online business card, resume, and cover letter all in one.
                      The clean and elegant code keeps things simple, but still highlights
                      the developers useful skills and contact information in a major way!

                    <p class="subheading">HTML 5 &amp; CSS Exercise</p>
                    <p>This is a HTML & CSS exercise focussed on creating a recipe
                      card with three different delicious recipes. This is a one page
                      layout site with three different sections, each section containing a different recipe.
                      Stylistically, this project was the most fun to work on because there were many
                      features about the page that needed to be customized to ultimately
                      achieve the organized and visually-appealing final product.
